# Free repository of ProxCP

This tool comes in various paid packages, and we all know that I try to be the last to pay for something, so here goes nothing.

## 🌲Structure:
- web:
    - patched config file

- daemon:
    - patched daemon file
<br><br>

## 🗒️ Source?:
Well, as you can tell theres not really much readable source-code here. You can have a look at old commits, and maybe some day we will actually fully decomp this, but for now this is the best I can offer.
<br><br>

## 🖥️ How does it work?
Its actually not too complicated. <a href="https://github.com/marcus-alicia/ProxCP/blob/main/web/lilib/proxcp_lilib_c.php">this file</a> contains the config. We were able to decrypt that. As you can see, it points to my license server, which just returns a valid check for whatever license you throw at it ❤️ Simply replace that file on your install with ours, and thats it.

If you dont like using my server, feel free to check the `license-server` branch here. It has the code you need to run.
